# Homework - OOP concepts

### Library Management System Requirements:

* Book Management: One can create instances of Book and FictionBook. Each book should have a title, author, and ISBN. FictionBook should inherit from Book and include an additional genre.

* Library Operations: The system should allow us to create instances of Library. One can add both regular and fiction books to the Library. The library should keep track of added books.

* Display Information: The Book and FictionBook classes should have a method displayInfo to display information about the book. FictionBook should override the displayInfo method to include genre information.

* Library Member Interaction: The system should allow us to create instances of LibraryMember. Each library member should have a name and a list of borrowed books. Library members should be able to borrow books from the library.

* Borrowing Books: The system should display the contents of books borrowed by a library member. The library should be able to keep track of books borrowed by library members.

* The homework should contain one HTML and one JS file. Put those files into one archive. Name the archive using the following pattern: your-name-js-oop-homework.
